            At Vincero, weâ€™re not big on trends or seasons. We add to our collection methodically as we want each collection to be just right. 
            On average, a new product will take us around a year to design and prototype.   
            Our process starts with concept drawings and 3D renderings here in our San Diego HQ.
            Then it goes through the first iteration of machine sampling to produce all the parts in a non-assembled structure.
            From there we piece things together by hand, matching dial designs and case shapes with band styles.
            Finally, we proceed with two rounds of sampling and real-world testing before an actual order is placed.
